NARG
(Neff's Alchemical Recipe Generator)  
  
A tool I made to generate alchemy recipes for Noita. I reimplemented the RNG code, which means it also works offline.
  
Usage: narg [options] SEED  
Options:  
    `-a`, `--array`         prints in comma-delimited format (seed#,x,x,x,y,y,y)  
    `-h`, `--help`          print this help menu
